This script is intended to automatically shut down the system if the user unintentionally falls asleep.

Step by step :
  1. Import the 'Anti-Keturon Shutdown System.xml' File to the Task Scheduler, That's it!
  (Optional) import the 'Anti-Keturon Shutdown System Warning.xml' , u'll gonna need to re-adjust the file location for this.
  2. Try to Run the script for testing purpose.
  3. If the test suceed, there'll be a logging out notification 
  4. To cancel the Shutdown countdown, use 'shutdown -a' command in the Command Prompt
  5. Happy Living~


About :
As I said above, this script is intended to automatically shut down the system After a configured Time (default is 15min) if the user(You) unintentionally falls asleep.
This script is made and intended AS IS, and nothing else. This hope extends your machine life by shutting it down when you aren't using it, also. Reducing the bills (hopefully)
You can change the idle trigger time by Opening the Task Scheduler > Double click at my Script 'Anti-Keturon Shutdown System' > Conditions, there you can change the idle trigger by your own
This was just a simple script made by me, cuz I was unintenionally falls asleep a lot.
